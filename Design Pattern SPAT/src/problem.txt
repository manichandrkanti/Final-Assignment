I face problem coding observer design pattern. I want to alert all of students about their performance report when it is generated by system but I did not know how to put that alert call. I searched for some examples and finally put it in Tool class where most of functions are happening. Now wehn I generate report, it notifies all students that their report has been published. I put 2 students currently so You can see only 2 alerts on screen.
